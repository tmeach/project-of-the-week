## Packaging Python projects

### Overview

**Goal**: Get started learning some basic software engineering concepts. By the end of the week I've learned how successfully developed a Python package while incorporating essential best practices. These practices include executing unit tests, running a linter, and ensuring proper documentation to enhance the overall functionality and maintainability of your package.

**Dates**: from 30th August to 4th September.
