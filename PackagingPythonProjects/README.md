This project-of-the-week about Packaging Python projects

**Goal**: Get started learning some basic software engineering concepts. By the end of the week, you will have successfully developed a Python package while incorporating essential best practices. These practices include executing unit tests, running a linter, and ensuring proper documentation to enhance the overall functionality and maintainability of your package.

**Dates**: from 30th August to 4th September.

As a working python code I use my Telegram python bot code. This bot allows you convert currency pair whatever you want. For this project I worked with telebot and currency_converter libraries.
